# Minimalist PHP framework for fast web apps development
## by SkyWodd

This framework have been created for my previous end-of-year project at my computer science school.
This framework is no longer updated, so I release it as GNU GPL V3.
Use it as you want but keep in mind that it will not be supported anymore.

Ps: please also keep in mind that this framework have been coded one year ago and with no real unit-test and debugging.
So some class / functions can be really crapy or maybe simply not work properly ...

This framework include a lot of things, from barcode generator to user management.
A relatively complete HTML template engine is also included.
